# AudioSilence

1. **Parallel Processing**:

    - Utilize multi-threading or multi-processing to speed up the analysis and movement of files, especially if dealing with a large library. Python's `concurrent.futures` module could be used for this purpose.
2. **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism**:
    - Enhance error handling to provide more detailed information, especially for common issues like file access errors.
3. **Logging Enhancements**:

    - Add more detailed logging, such as the duration of silence detected and the total processing time for each file.
    - Consider implementing different logging levels (e.g., INFO, DEBUG) that can be configured based on the user's preference.
4. **Progress Feedback**:

    - Improve the progress feedback in the console, possibly by displaying the current file being processed and its progress percentage.
5. **Configurable Silence Detection Parameters**:

    - Allow the user to configure the silence threshold and minimum silence length through command-line arguments or a configuration file.
7. **Database or Record Keeping**:

    - Maintain a database or a simple record file to track processed files. This can prevent re-processing the same files and help in auditing.
