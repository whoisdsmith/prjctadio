1. **Ingest Audio Library**

To ingest an audio library, you will need to:

* **Collect audio files.** You can collect audio files from a variety of sources, such as online music stores, streaming services, or your own personal collection.
* **Convert audio files to a common format.** You will need to convert audio files to a common format, such as WAV or MP3, before you can analyze them.
* **Store audio files in a central location.** You will need to store audio files in a central location, such as a hard drive or a cloud storage service, before you can analyze them.

2. **Analyze Audio Files**

Once you have ingested an audio library, you will need to analyze the audio files to extract the following information:

* **Key signature.** The key signature of a song is the set of notes that are used in the song.
* **BPM.** The BPM of a song is the number of beats per minute.
* **Time signature.** The time signature of a song is the number of beats in a measure.
* **Genre.** The genre of a song is the musical style of the song.
* **Audio fingerprint.** The audio fingerprint of a song is a unique identifier that can be used to identify the song.
* **Song structure.** The song structure of a song is the arrangement of the different sections of the song, such as the intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, and outro.

3. **Organize the Analyzed Audio Library**

Once you have analyzed the audio files, you will need to organize them into the following folder structure:

* **Genre.** The first level of organization should be by genre.
* **Key signature.** The second level of organization should be by key signature.
* **BPM.** The third level of organization should be by BPM.

4. **Search Features**

Once you have organized the analyzed audio library, you will need to add search features to allow users to search for songs by the following criteria:

* **Key signature.** Users should be able to search for songs by key signature.
* **Tempo.** Users should be able to search for songs by tempo.
* **Genre.** Users should be able to search for songs by genre.
* **Similar songs.** Users should be able to search for songs that are similar to a given song.

5. **Optional Features**

In addition to the basic search features, you can also add the following optional features:

* **Extract sections of song structure.** Users should be able to extract sections of song structure, such as the intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, and outro.
* **Split songs into stems.** Users should be able to split songs into stems, such as vocals, guitars, bass, keys, and drums.
